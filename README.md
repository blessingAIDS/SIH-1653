## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
1. Virtual Boardroom Experience
A simulated panel that replicates a real-life interview scenario.
Dynamic questioning: The system starts with introductory questions and progresses towards in-depth technical and managerial questions based on candidate responses.
Multi-expert integration: Multiple assessors can participate and provide real-time evaluations.
2. Intelligent Questioning System
Adaptive Questioning: AI dynamically adjusts the complexity of questions based on the candidate’s profile and past responses.
Domain-Specific Questioning: Questions are tailored to the candidate’s expertise, ensuring relevance.
Question Relevance Scoring: AI assigns a score to each question’s appropriateness concerning the candidate’s area of expertise.
3. Candidate Response Evaluation
AI-Assisted Scoring: Each response is analyzed for:
Relevance to the question
Technical depth
Clarity of explanation
Confidence and communication
Automated Feedback: AI provides insights into strengths and areas for improvement.
4. Quantifiable Scoring Mechanism
Relevancy Scoring: Both questions posed and responses given are assigned scores to maintain fairness and objectivity.
Final Suitability Score: The system aggregates the scores to generate a final assessment score, helping in decision-making.
5. User-Friendly & Secure System
Secure login for experts and candidates
Real-time analytics and reporting
Video recording for audit and future reference
